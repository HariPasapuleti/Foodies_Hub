# main.jsx

1. React applications are often structured as single-page applications (SPAs), where the entire app runs on a single HTML page(index.html), dynamically updating the content without reloading the page. The root element acts as a container for all the components and dynamically updates as the user interacts with the app.

2. ReactDOM: Core libraries for building and rendering the React application.

3. App: The main component of the application, typically the root component that will contain all other components.
4. index.css: The global CSS file for styling.
BrowserRouter: A component from react-router-dom for enabling client-side routing.
5. BrowserRouter is ideal for applications that require multiple pages or views. It allows for dynamic navigation between these views without the need to reload the page, thus providing a more fluid user experience.
6. StoreContextProvider: StoreContextProvider is a custom component typically created using React's Context API. It provides a way to manage and share global state across the entire application or a part of it.

7. ReactDOM.createRoot: Creates a root DOM node for rendering the React application.
8. document.getElementById('root'): Fetches the root DOM element with the ID root (typically defined in the index.html file)(document). Access elements in the DOM: You can use methods like getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName to retrieve specific elements.

9. The render method takes a JSX element to render the components wrapped with BrowserRouter for routing and StoreContextProvider for state management.



# App.jsx

1.  `{showLogin? <LoginPopUp setShowLogin = { setShowLogin }/> : <></>}`
This line is a conditional (ternary) expression that checks the value of showLogin.
If showLogin is true, the LoginPopUp component is rendered, and setShowLogin is passed as a prop to LoginPopUp to allow it to change the state.
If showLogin is false, an empty fragment <></> is rendered, effectively rendering nothing in its place.
2. `<Navbar setShowLogin = {setShowLogin}/>`
This line renders a Navbar component and passes setShowLogin as a prop to it.
The Navbar can call setShowLogin to change the value of showLogin, for example, to show or hide the login popup.
3. `<Route path = '/cart' element = {<Cart/>} />`
This line defines a route for the path /cart, which will render the Cart component when the user navigates to this URL.

# StoreContext

1. The contextValue object contains all the relevant state (food_list, cartItems, token) and functions (setCartItems, addToCart, removeFromCart, getTotalCartAmount, setToken) needed to manage the state of the store. This centralization allows for a single source of truth, making the state management more predictable and easier to debug.
2. By encapsulating all these variables and functions into contextValue, the StoreContextProvider component efficiently manages and shares the state across the application. This approach enhances maintainability, reduces boilerplate code, and improves the overall architecture of the application.


# Functionality

1. Link is used for client-side navigation between routes without causing a full page reload.
2. useNavigate is a hook that provides a function for programmatic navigation within the app.
3. createContext: A function from React that creates a Context object. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
4. useState: A React hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.
5. useEffect: A React hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data or directly manipulating the DOM.
6. axios: A library for making HTTP requests to interact with the backend API.
7. useSearchParams: A hook that allows you to read and modify the query parameters of the URL.
